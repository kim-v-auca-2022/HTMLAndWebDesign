                <h1>Goals in this website</h1>
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <div>The overall computer programming professions develop in the current age, but yet, the need of
                    programmers from many companies is still relevant. That's why it is essential to have courses on
                    specific spheres of programming for public needs, whether creating artificial intelligence for cars,
                    or makiing astronomical calculations on other planets, or creating new operating systems. In this
                    website the main focus here is to teach website designs, one of the most important parts of product
                    representations on the internet. It has many needs from various fields: representing online shops,
                    new products, forums on specific questions, even social media such as YouTube. Without good website
                    designs, any product, whether good or bad, wouldn't gain much attention in the long run.</div>
                <h2>Audience</h2>
                <div>Everyone, who is capable on understanding the basic consepts of programming (such as variables,
                    condition statements, loops and others) are allowed to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript features with
                    no problem</div>
                <h2>CTA (Call To Action)</h2>
                <div>Users should see the basic HTML tags and their functions that are commonly used in many websites,
                    and can use them for brief summary or as a cheatlist for the future projects that might be usefull
