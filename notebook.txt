* "p*4>lorem5 + tab"
"p*4" - print <p> tag 4 times
"lorem5" - print lorem text with 5 words

* We could make double references in style (article div {}) to make specific changes
article div, button {} - make changes in div And button inside article tag (if div and button are seperated)
"," in this case apply changes to tags in one equal level

* Classes can have multiple names (<div class:"padding margin">)
Padding in website is essencial (like pauses in theatres)

CSS Box Model:
1. block
2. inline - padding and margin doesn't work properly

Padding - takes spaces inside block
Margin - takes spaces outside of the box

* Margin in body by default is shifted by 8px (based on browser settings)
to remove the body margin: "body {margin: 0px; padding: 0px;}"

* "box-sizing: border-box" in style completely changes the width and height properties;
(width value corresponds to the sum of all values in Box Model)
