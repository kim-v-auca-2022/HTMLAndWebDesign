        <h1>Hello HTML... again</h1>
        <p class="text1">First experiences of learning zis programming was quite rich, 
            but overwhelming, since final project from previous years in college 
            made me rush too much :( <br><b>But</b> needless to say, while I was making a project, 
            <i> I did manage to learn most of HTML tags at least on the basic level 
                <b>(even if I didn't use most of 'em in the final project lel :) ).</b></i></p>
        
        <h2> HTML tags I've learned so far </h2>
        <div class="text2">
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com"> This is a link tag (a) that leads to the Youtube website </a>
            <ul>
                <li> This is a several tag mix of (ul) and (li) which make a list thingy </li>
                <li> and can have as many dots as possible (by spamming (li) )</li>
                <li> There was a graphical representation of list (like picture slides in online shops) but didn't know how to make it :( )
            </ul>
            <br>
            <input type="text"> <br>
            <p> Above is an input text with (input) tag that allows to enter various data <br> 
                There was an (img) tag that allows to import image and also with option to make image clickable, 
                but don't know how to implement it in jsbin :/ <br> 
                Don't know how to color the words using only HTML, <i>but it's possible with CSS file</i>, 
                and implementing names of CSS properties into tags </p>
